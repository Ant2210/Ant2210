# Hi there, I'm Ant üëã

I am a highly motivated professional who recently achieved a Level 5 Diploma in Full Stack Web Applications with distinction. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, I have hands-on experience with technologies such as React, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Flask, Django, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Git, and jQuery. 

After a decade in financial services, I am eager to transition into software development, leveraging my problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and project management skills. I am passionate about innovation and excited to find and contribute to a dynamic and creative team.
